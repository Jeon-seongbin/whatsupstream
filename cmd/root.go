Say, there is an active OSS repository and you want to take up a good first issue as soon as one opens up.
Now, in real life, this is tough because you can't just keep on checking the issues of that repo every minute.
And someone might take up that issue before you too.
So, whatsupstream can notify you in almost real-time whenever such issue comes up.
And you can tweak whatsupstream to notify you for any other kind or category of issues.`,
